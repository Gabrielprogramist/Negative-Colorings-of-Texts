**Project Title: Negative Colorings of Texts: Analysis and Influence on People**

This project aims to analyze and classify the negative colorings of texts and their influence on people. It is a web application built with Django and uses a machine learning model for text classification.

**Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Prerequisites**
•	Python 3.8 or higher
•	Django 4.2.1 or higher
•	PyTorch 1.10 or higher
•	Transformers 4.11 or higher

**Installation**
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Gabrielprogramist/Negative-Colorings-of-Texts.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd path

2.	Install the required packages:
pip install …

3.	Run the Django server:
python manage.py runserver
